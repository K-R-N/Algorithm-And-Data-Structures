Implement the bubble sort algorithm. A basic definition of bubble sort is given as:

    Start from index 0 in the array and check every two consecutive elements, if the left element is greater than the right element, swap the two elements.
    When the bubble is at the end of the array, the largest element will be in the last position of the array.
    Repeat this process from step 2, however this time only up until the last element in the previous iteration.

```java
class Solution {

  /**
   * Sorts an array of integers in ascending order, this operation needs to be in-place.
   *
   * @param arr the array of integers that needs to be sorted in ascending order.
   */
  public static void bubbleSort(int[] arr) {
     for(int i=0; i < arr.length; i++){  
        for(int j=1; j < (arr.length-i); j++){  
          if(arr[j-1] > arr[j]){  
             int temp = arr[j-1];  
             arr[j-1] = arr[j];  
             arr[j] = temp;  
           }  
         }  
      }
  }
}


```
